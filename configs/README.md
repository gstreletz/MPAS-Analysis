# MPAS-Analysis

Example config files for various HPC machines and various runs.

The intended usage is to copy one of these examples to the root of 
MPAS-Analysis (where `run_mpas_analysis` is located) before modifying them
(e.g. setting the output `baseDirectory`) and using them to run the
analysis.

To run tasks in parallel, instead copy and modify the machine-specific job 
script or the default job script.
