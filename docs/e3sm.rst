E3SM
====

The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project, previously known as
ACME, is central to ESM as well as many of the Climate and Environmental
Sciences Division activities, as it is developing a computationally advanced
coupled climate-energy model to investigate the challenges posed by the
interactions of weather-climate scale variability with energy and related
sectors.

A Full description of E3SM is available at:

Setting up E3SM runs
--------------------

All online analysis and output stream within MPAS components (MPAS-O and
MPAS-SeaIce) are configured to support MPAS-Analysis without any modifications
to namelists or streams files.
