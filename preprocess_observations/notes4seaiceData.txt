SSMI NASATeam or Bootstrap: Milena computed climatologies from the binary files
using the compute_climo.m scripts. The resulting netcdf files contain the fields
on the original stereographic projection. Mat then interpolated these
fields onto regular lat/lon grids.

ICESat Arctic: a similar procedure as the SSMI data was taken.

ICESat Antarctic: this data was only available for Feb/Mar and Oct/Nov, in ASCII
format. Milena cannot find preprocessing scripts for this data, so she is thinking
that probably Mat processed the ASCII data (already FM/ON climos) directly.

IceArea_timeseries: Milena used the txt2netcdf.m scripts to go from the ASCII
files to netcdf.
